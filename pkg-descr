The AbuseIPDB Checker plugin monitors external IP addresses attempting 
to connect to your internal network and checks them against the AbuseIPDB 
reputation database to identify potential threats.

This plugin parses firewall logs for external IPs, checks them against
the AbuseIPDB API, stores results in a local SQLite database, and can
send email notifications for detected threats.
